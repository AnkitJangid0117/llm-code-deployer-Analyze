# Single Page Web Application

This web app provides a simple interface to run a pre-processed data script and view its output.

## Usage
Click the "Run Data Processing" button to fetch and display the result JSON generated by the backend.

Note: The backend should serve the files and run the `execute.py` script on GitHub Actions.
